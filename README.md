learning Numpy 
why we use numpy ?
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray , it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.



One of the most popular general-purpose programming languages of today is Python. There are a number of reasons why it has become so popular in a variety of fields like Data Science, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, etc. However, one of the most striking features of Python which makes it stand out amongst other programming languages is its rich set of libraries. Among these libraries, two of the most commonly used and most popular ones are Pandas and NumPy. Both Pandas and NumPy are two important tools in the Python SciPy stack that can be used for any scientific computation, for instance, performing high-performance matrix computations to Machine Learning functions and many more. In this article, we are going to discuss all these amazingly powerful libraries.

Key Features of NumPy
Now that we know a bit about what NumPy is, let us take a look at some of the key features it has to offer:

One of the most striking features of NumPy is the “ndarray” for dealing with n-dimensional arrays and data structures.
Programs related to matrices and n-dimensional arrays can be run really very fast using NumPy.
It provides effective linear algebra computations by relying on BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package).
NumPy can be addressed as a universal data structure in OpenCV for images, filter kernels, extracted feature points, etc.
One of the not-so-good features of NumPy is that it does not allow easy appending of data entries to arrays as quickly as Python does.
NumPy contains a lot of tools for the integration of code from C/C++ and Fortran.
The arrays in NumPy are of homogenous nature. It contains a multidimensional container for generic data (parameterized data type of arrays).
Complex operations on linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random numbers can also be performed using NumPy.
NumPy also consists of Broadcasting functions. This makes it extremely useful while dealing with arrays of uneven shapes as it broadcasts the shape of smaller arrays according to the larger ones.
NumPy has data type definition capability to work with varied databases.
